    <h1>Pawline, my friend with a beautiful soul :)</h1>
    <h2>Let me tell you a little bit about this wonderful creature!</h2>
    <h3>Some of their qualites that I admire:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>They are independent!</li>
        <li>They clean themself really well</li>
        <li>They get free food everyday</li>
        <li>They live outside</li>
    <h4>Here are just a couple of pictures of Pawline in different places</h4>

    <h4><strong>Pawline has a friend in the neighborhood named Timmy, who is also feline!</strong></h4>
    <h4>Unlike Pawline, Timmy lives inside and loves to cuddle with human people... Check him out!</h4>

    <h3>"The life of a cat isn't all cuddles and saucers of milk", says Pawline's arch enemy Friskers with an evil hiss!</h3>
      <img src="1Friskers.jpg" alt="Friskers a grey and brown striped short hair cat stands perched atop a fence with a malicious stare in their eye">
    <h2>But Pawline never let's Friskers get her down and always tries to help them whenever possible.  Pawline knows that Friskers has some cuddles in their heart somewhere ;)</h2>
