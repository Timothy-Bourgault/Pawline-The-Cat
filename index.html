        <li>They are independent!</li>
        <li>They clean themself really well</li>
        <li>They get free food everyday</li>

    <h4 class="garbage"><strong>Pawline has a friend in the neighborhood named Timmy, who is also feline!</strong></h4>

    <h2 class="style">But Pawline never let's Friskers get her down and always tries to help them whenever possible.  Pawline knows that Friskers has some cuddles in their heart somewhere ;)</h2>
